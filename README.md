# Stack-Overflow-Developer-Analysis

--- 
Being a developer, you might wonder:

- Will you earn more salary as you gain more experience? If so how much more?
- Do other factors such as the former degree, position type, and the size of the company affect your salaries?

In this project, we will answer these questions by analysing the dataset from Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2021 using visualizations and Bayesian inference.
