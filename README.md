# Stack-Overflow-Developer-Analysis

--- 
Being a developer, you might wonder:

- Will you earn more salary as you gain more experience? If so how much more?
- Do other factors such as the former degree, position type, and the size of the company affect your salaries?

In this project, we will try to answer these questions using visualizations and Bayesian inference.
